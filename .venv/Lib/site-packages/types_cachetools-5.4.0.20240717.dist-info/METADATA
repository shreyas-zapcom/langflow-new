## Typing stubs for cachetools

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`cachetools`](https://github.com/tkem/cachetools) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`cachetools`.

This version of `types-cachetools` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `cachetools==5.4.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/cachetools. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`6d68b57d7419fd6a5d2924c6cc540ac0377c8d7c`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/6d68b57d7419fd6a5d2924c6cc540ac0377c8d7c) and was tested
with mypy 1.10.1, pyright 1.1.371, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
